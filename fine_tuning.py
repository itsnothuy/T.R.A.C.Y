    Placeholder for a QA model fine-tuning process.
    
    Steps you'd typically do (not implemented here):
    
    1. Load a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, or an open LLM).
    2. Load a QA dataset (like SQuAD).
    3. Preprocess data into (question, context, answer) format.
    4. Train or fine-tune using a trainer (Hugging Face Transformers) for a certain number of epochs.
    5. Save the fine-tuned model.
    
    In practice, you'd end up with a local or remote model checkpoint that can be used
    for embeddings, or for direct QA tasks, or even as a better re-ranker in RAG.
